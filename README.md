# Q-Learnig-reinforcement-learing:
## Definition : 
Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of an action in a particular state. It does not require a model of the environment (hence "model-free"), and it can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards without requiring adaptations.
Q-Learning poses an idea of assessing the quality of an action that is taken to move to a state rather than determining the possible value of the state (value footprint) being moved to.
